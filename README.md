# Declarative Custom Elements

This is not intended to be a proposal for the Declarative Custom Elements (DCE) spec design, but a high-level capture of possible features and a proposal for a potential roll-out plan.

## Key Focus Areas

Key areas of the DCE spec that should be focused on and proposed implementation order are:

- DCE definition and static templating
- Attribute definition and template value binding
- Declarative templating

## Additional Considerations

Areas that are related, but can be developed in parallel and should not be blockers of the proposal are:

- HTML and CSS Modules
- Editor support for DCEs
