# Declarative Custom Elements

This is not intended to be a proposal for the Declarative Custom Elements (DCE) spec design, but a high-level capture of possible features and a proposal for a potential roll-out plan.

## Key Focus Areas

Key areas of the DCE spec that should be focused on and proposed implementation order are:

- [DCE definition and static templating](/dce-definition.md)
- [Attribute definition and template value binding](/attributes.md)
- [Declarative templating](declarative-dom-templating.md)

## Additional Considerations

Areas that are related, but can be developed in parallel and should not be blockers of the proposal are:

- [HTML and CSS Modules](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/HTML-Imports-and-ES-Modules.md)
- Editor support for DCEs
